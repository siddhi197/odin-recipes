                    <h2>Description: </h2>
                    <p>
                        Sautéed scallops are a delectable seafood delicacy made by quickly cooking fresh scallops in a hot pan with a bit of butter or oil until they are golden brown and caramelized on the outside, while remaining tender and succulent on the inside. The delicate sweetness of the scallops pairs perfectly with the rich flavor imparted by the butter or oil, creating a dish that is both elegant and satisfying. Sautéed scallops are often served as an appetizer or main course, accompanied by a variety of side dishes such as risotto, pasta, or a fresh salad.

                        These sautéed scallops with garlic and rosemary are so delicious! Just crush the garlic with the side of a chef's knife blade instead of chopping it, and use whole sprigs of rosemary to allow them to be easily removed before serving.
